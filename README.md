The Ogallala Aquifer underlies approximately 175,000 square miles and provides water for commercial, residential and agricultural customers across the High Plains. It is the primary water source for portions of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming and parts of South Dakota. According the a US Geological Survey report issued on June 16, 2017, it is also in decline.

This project constsists of a linear regression analysis of water quality (total dissolved solids (mg/L)) and a two-way analysis of variance of water level (ft) trends in the Panhandle Region of Texas, from 1925 to 2016. We hope to identify linear trends in water quality, with the goal of identifying factors that will best predict water quality in the coming years.

## Data Description
Our data comes from the Texas Groundwater database: http://www.twdb.texas.gov/groundwater/data/gwdbrpt.asp
We obtained observational data on each well in the state, including water quality samples and water level measurements.
